## About Judy

I am a microbial ecologist and currently a postdoctoral researcher in King lab at UBC. I love fairy tales, detective stories and puzzles. I am passionate about accessible science communication (see Outreach), and promoting equity and inclusion in science (see EDI). When I am away from my desk and lab bench, I like hiking, swimming and observing moving objects.

## Research Interests

Microbial symbiosis is ubiquitous in nature, spanning the mutualism-to-parasitism continuum. My research integrates multi-omics, quantitative ecology and experimental evolution to investigate how environmental change reshapes host-microbiome-pathogen interactions, and how these dynamics feed back onto host fitness. I currently use metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, individual-based modeling and phylogenetic approaches to study microbial communities across individual and population levels in wild mammals such as polar bears.
