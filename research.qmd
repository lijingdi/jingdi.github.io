### How do environmental changes reshape microbial symbiosis?

::: {#hero-heading}
Microbial symbiosis is ubiquitous in nature, spanning the
mutualism-to-parasitism continuum. Global climate change has led to more
extreme thermal events. The extent to which non-pathogenic microbiome
communities change in response to warming or cooling may be important
for predicting host performance under global change ([Li *et al.,*
2025](https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.001523 "Microbial Primer: Microbiome and thermal tolerance – a new frontier in climate resilience?")).
Using a meta-analysis of 1377 microbiomes from 43 terrestrial and
aquatic species, we found a decrease in the amplicon sequence
variant-level microbiome phylogenetic diversity and alteration of
microbiome composition under both experimental warming and cooling. We
showed that the host habitat and experimental factors affected
microbiome diversity and composition more than host biological traits
([Li *et al.*,
2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16429 "Experimental temperatures shape host microbiome diversity and composition")).

Warming events can sometimes lead to more infectious disease outbreaks,
putting animal persistence at risk. The extent to which warming
temperatures and infection may together impair host health is unclear.
Using a meta-analysis of \>190 effect sizes representing 101 ectothermic
animal host–pathogen systems, we demonstrate that warming significantly
increased the mortality of hosts infected by bacterial pathogens.
Pathogens that have been evolutionarily established within the host
species showed higher virulence under warmer temperatures. We found that
compared to established infections, novel infections were more deadly at
lower/baseline temperatures. We revealed that the virulence of fungal
pathogens increased only when temperatures were shifted upwards towards
the pathogen thermal optimum ([Li *et al.,*
2024](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002900 "Excess mortality of infected ectotherms induced by warming depends on pathogen kingdom and evolutionary history")).

Understanding how microbiome structures change in response to infection
and warming may be important for forecasting host performance under
global change. To move beyond pairwise host-microbiome or host-pathogen
interactions, we evaluated alterations in the microbiomes of several
wild *Caenorhabditis elegans* isolates spanning a range of latitudes,
upon warming temperatures and infection by the parasite *Leucobacter
musarum*. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we found that microbiome diversity
decreased, and dispersion increased over time, with the former being
more prominent in uninfected adults and the latter aggravated by
infection. Exposing infected hosts to warming did not have an additive
destabilizing effect on their microbiomes. Moreover, warming during
pre-adult development alleviated the destabilizing effects of infection
on host microbiomes ([Li *et al.,*
2024](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2023.0069 "Dual stressors of infection and warming can destabilize host microbiomes")).

### How does warming impact animal resistance ecology and evolution?

Climate change is increasing extreme heating events which may
potentially exacerbate infectious diseases. Whether hosts can adapt to
infection with rising temperatures is important for forecasting species
persistence. We tested whether warming—at different host life
stages—affects the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of resistance in
*Caenorhabditis elegans* infected by a wild bacterial pathogen. We
competed resistant and susceptible genotypes across 10 passages and
tracked the spread of resistance in the population. Infection and
prolonged warming strongly selected for the resistant genotype. Warming
during host development induced plastic defences against infection,
reducing the selective pressure for costly genetic-based resistance.
Resistance was lost under ambient temperatures and periodic warming.
Selection for resistance was likely weakened at ambient temperatures by
the dilution effect, whereby the resistant genotype reduced pathogen
transmission. Evolutionary dynamics of resistance depend on the balance
among pathogen virulence, costs of genetic-based resistance, the
dilution effect and plastic defences induced by temperature stress ([Li
*et al.,*
2025](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.70087 "Warming During Different Life Stages has Distinct Impacts on Host Resistance Ecology and Evolution")).

### What drives microbiome stability vs. flexibility in wild mammals and how these dynamics feed back onto host fitness?

While experimental systems are valuable for isolating microbial
responses to specific perturbances, understanding the fitness
consequences of microbiome dynamics in nature requires longitudinal
studies at both individual and population levels in wild populations.
Most existing work either captures population-level patterns at single
timepoint, or relies on laboratory-maintained animals whose microbiomes
may not reflect the ecological complexity and variability of natural
environments. As a result, we still lack a clear understanding of the
drivers of microbiome temporal dynamics, the conditions under which
microbiome stability versus flexibility is beneficial, and how these
dynamics translate into host fitness outcomes in the wild. Addressing
this gap is critical for understanding how microbiome-mediated processes
influence animal health and conservation outcomes in a rapidly changing
world.

My postdoctoral research is currently focusing on addressing this gap by
studying microbiome stability and variation in wild mammals, using polar
bear as a model system. Polar bears are apex predators and key
indicators of Arctic ecosystem health, with populations increasingly
threatened by climate change. Polar bears typically experience extreme
nutritional stress (prolonged fasting), especially during up to 8-month
winter denning period for pregnant females. These conditions provide a
natural experiment for identifying microbial taxa that persist under
severe perturbation. These persistent microbial taxa may represent
functionally or evolutionarily essential components of the host
microbiome.

The Churchill polar bear population in Canada is among the most
intensively monitored in the world. Through our collaboration, we have
obtained microbiome samples (both rectal and nasal swabs) from over 200
bears across four timepoints over multiple years. Using metagenomics and
metatranscriptomics, combined with detailed bear metadata, family and
geographical information, I will first differentiate host-associated
persistent vs. transient microbial taxa, and analyze their evolutionary
histories and metabolic functions. We will further investigate how RNA
viral infections disrupt microbial stability. Linking viral diversity to
microbial restructuring and host body conditions will provide
mechanistic insight into microbiome-mediated infection outcomes.
