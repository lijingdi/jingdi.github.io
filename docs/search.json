    "text": "One of my hobbies is translating complex scientific concepts into cute stories or poetic forms, below are some poems I wrote about host-associated microbes. If you share the same interest or you’d like an accessible version of your research, feel free to get in touch!\n\nThe generalist’s lament\n(This is a poetic form of generalist microbes’ lifestyle)\nNever did I think to land here, cold and dark, where hunger bites,\nI yearn for the warm, nutritious, living ground,\nThe human sanctuary, that lord of endless lights—\nI miss the safety of the host from which I was unbound,\nBy the brutal command of fate’s relentless shedding.\n\nWho now will pick me up? I promise I will not strike.\nI scan the soil and air, assessing every fleeting change.\nI must adapt, for life is nothing but kinetic range.\nLet me adjust and repair, and now I am renewed.\n\nBut wait—a host appears! I’m lifted, picked up fast.\nForgive the honest lie: this shift has made me sharp and bold.\nMy previous mild nature could not possibly last;\nYou never know which new defense the new environment will unfold.\n\nI pledge my hard survival; I labor to adjust to you,\nMy unexpected lord. You promise not to shed?\nWhat? Unbound again? Into the cold, dark world I’m thrown anew?\n\nThen, in the next life, let me be obligate instead.\nNo more the chaos of the shed, no more the generalist’s fate.\nOh, Host, I offer you my entire, perfect genome,\nTo trade this endless transit for the single, mighty gate:\nMy highest adaptation, for a permanent, singular home.\n\n\nThe myth of persistent microbes\nThe marriage of myth demands an unchanging vow:\nA promise of deep loyalty until death parts.\nSo too, within our bodies, do some microbes somehow\nMaintain their faithful presence, within our beating hearts.\n\nThey live, they shift, they bend, but fiercely they persist.\nThey persist when we change diet, or alter every pace;\nThey cling when new companions enter on our wrist;\nA quiet, unseen stability in a transient space.\n\nShall we praise their constancy, their unwavering, hidden stay?\nOr do they simply hold the most advantageous ground?\nShould we expel them, denying their essential utility,\nWhen their ancient, adapted function must aways be profound?\n\nWhat signatures do they carry,\nAnd are they one across us all?\nThe key to health’s equation remains the silent test:\nWhat is the cost of permanence, and where does the edge fall?\n\n\nVariation: the measure of potential and risk\nVariation is intrinsic, the spark of every soul,\nA deep, inherent signature that labels us unique.\nAnd uniqueness, we surrender, is the meaning of the whole.\nWithin the human kingdom, a microbial world is meek,\n\nYet variable. We crave the stillness, we plead for the stable hold,\nBut is stability ever fully kind?\nWe turn to flexibility, a story to be told,\nThough flexibility may leave safe tipping points behind.\n\nThey live, they shift, they change with every passing hour,\nBy food and time, and immunity’s unseen hand;\nWill the communities mend, or simply disappear?\nIs recovery the promise, or just oscillation in its place?\nUnderneath the chaos, there is potential wide,\nA deep and vital engine that offers defense and might.\nBut oh, the sudden fracture where all order starts to slide,\nWhen variation spills beyond the edges of the light.\n\nThe beneficial fade, they tear and leave a hollow space,\nAn invitation whispered to a parasite unseen.\nAnd then the darkness settles, replacing health and grace,\nDisease can happen, where stable life had been.\n\nVariation is a force, so vital and profound,\nWith both the risk of ruin and the promise to create.\nA double-edged existence upon this common ground.\n\n\nShifting along the mutualism-parasitism continuum\nThe only constant law in this vast, wet kingdom,\nIs the fierce, indifferent nature of the change itself.\nI never dreamt I’d turn against your sanctum,\nMy Lord, when first I claimed my portion of your wealth.\n\nI lived then by the ancient, commensal pact—\nA quiet tenant, helping you digest what you ingest,\nAnd I, receiving nourishment, made sure my needs were met.\n\nThe immune citadel may fence my roaming sphere,\nYet I was wholly content to shelter in your grace.\nBut peace is a fragile bond when peril hovers near;\n\nThen came the seismic rupture, the ecosystem’s shift,\nMy fellow residents were scattered, broken, or consumed.\nThe balance was undone, a necessary gift:\nI must now seize the bounty to escape the void’s ill-doomed.\n\nFrom this disorder, self-interest takes its root;\nThe contract shatters, giving way to necessary strife.\nI climb the sharp biological gradient for my loot—\nI flourish in your waning, demanding more from life.\n\nI feel the strange remorse, yet my expansion is now assured;\nI rule this tiny, conquering, thriving colony—\nYour failing pulse, my Lord, is a price I have endured.\n\nDo not mistake this sudden shift for treachery,\nThis is the brilliant, amoral logic of the cell.\nFor I may shift once more and be your friend, or not. Who can tell?\n\n\nThe Cheater’s Calculus\n(This is about cooperation and cheating in a microbial community)\nI never thought the gamble would fail,\nA low, conspiratorial laugh I send on the breeze—\nCan you believe I draw the public good, without labor or fee?\nI steal the communal wealth, and never once derail.\n\nDo not judge the ethics of my small design,\nYou would perform the same cheater’s calculus if you were I:\nImagine a world where fitness is only mine,\nMaximizing every gain beneath a costless sky.\n\nI would choose this perfect theft a thousand times,\nA singular existence of pure, unburdened resource.\n\nBut wait—a sudden barrier cuts across my climbs!\nHave they found the geometry to interrupt my course?\nA spatial lock! Now I am held and contained by the wall,\nAnd cannot reach the source of the sweet, delicious yield.\n\nThey are insidious, aren’t they? To engineer my fall…\nYou say I am the deceitful one upon this field?\n\nSilence! I am merely social, pursuing my own might.\nWhy judge a tiny microbe by a human, rigid code?\nIf we are all ambitious, seeking the core of light,\nThen my simple cheater’s strategy is just the established road."

Maybe in the parallel universe, another version of me would have unlimited funding to investigate them all (if they were not yet resolved). You are welcome to get in touch if any of the ideas attracts you as well, and we can start a conversation!\n\n\nWhy are females sometimes less social? Could some females avoid social contact because being social increases the risk of catching infections that might harm their babies? Comparing species with different parenting styles (mother-only care vs. shared care) and individuals varying across reproductive states (pregnant vs. non-reproductive females) could reveal to what extent disease risk helps shape social behavior.\n\n\nDo changing environments help maintain genetic diversity within species? Monnet et al. 2025 shows that plants establish species barriers faster than animals. Maybe it’s because the more plastic/changing environment that animals live in so that they can bear more potential cost of variable allele than plants.\n\nWhen social contact changes the microbiome? When animals interact socially, how often do they pick up new microbial taxa that actually dominate their microbiome? – if that’s the case, we may see decreased alpha diversity from microbiome exposure.\nWhat are different evolutionary trajectories of pathogens in hosts with different levels of resistance? Despite many theoretical studies, no common rule found across empirical observations.\nParasite diversity accelerates host evolution, and rapid evolution within host populations leads to accelerated divergence. Whether and when would this lead to speciation?\nIs a stable microbiome always better than a changing one? Some studies (eg. in coral and their microbiomes) suggest not. Under what circumstances that microbiome stability vs. flexibility are beneficial for hosts? Apparently we can’t just regard high microbiome alpha diversity as “good” or beneficial.\nWhat happens when social “hubs” disappear? If the most socially connected people or animals disappear, how does the group change? For example, in my department, if interactions between everyone being tracked and recorded, a social network with individual person as nodes will be drawn. Individuals with the most links would be central or key hubs, and they can be the department head or administrative staff, or an unexpected colleague who turns out to be a social butterfly. If one of the central hubs is absent (eg. people on leave), how would the social network change?\nIn the west, there is an old saying: Take a third, leave a third, and share a third. This number “1/3” may be from the observation that harvesting around one-third often allows populations to replenish themselves. Interestingly, in Chinese traditional culture, 《道德经》里有“道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物。” 应用到生态管理上，可以形成 “天、地、人”三才和谐共生的最高原则。上面的英文俗语，可以理解为：take a third：人类取用一份；leave a third：留一份归地（土地自我修复、物种延续）；share a third：与天享一份（风调雨顺、自然循环）。What an interesting coincidence!\nDid morality evolve because we need each other? Did morality arise to help people cooperate, and would it disappear if cooperation weren’t needed? Many moral rules help build trust and prevent cheating. Would human stop pursuing morality in a world without social living?\nIn human history, how often do leadership help or cause harm? What about in animal world?\nTo be continued…"

    "text": "How do environmental changes reshape microbial symbiosis?\n\nMicrobial symbiosis is ubiquitous in nature, spanning the mutualism-to-parasitism continuum. Global climate change has led to more extreme thermal events. The extent to which non-pathogenic microbiome communities change in response to warming or cooling may be important for predicting host performance under global change (Li et al., 2025). Using a meta-analysis of 1377 microbiomes from 43 terrestrial and aquatic species, we found a decrease in the amplicon sequence variant-level microbiome phylogenetic diversity and alteration of microbiome composition under both experimental warming and cooling. We showed that the host habitat and experimental factors affected microbiome diversity and composition more than host biological traits (Li et al., 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarming events can sometimes lead to more infectious disease outbreaks, putting animal persistence at risk. The extent to which warming temperatures and infection may together impair host health is unclear. Using a meta-analysis of &gt;190 effect sizes representing 101 ectothermic animal host–pathogen systems, we demonstrate that warming significantly increased the mortality of hosts infected by bacterial pathogens. Pathogens that have been evolutionarily established within the host species showed higher virulence under warmer temperatures. We found that compared to established infections, novel infections were more deadly at lower/baseline temperatures. We revealed that the virulence of fungal pathogens increased only when temperatures were shifted upwards towards the pathogen thermal optimum (Li et al., 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how microbiome structures change in response to infection and warming may be important for forecasting host performance under global change. To move beyond pairwise host-microbiome or host-pathogen interactions, we evaluated alterations in the microbiomes of several wild Caenorhabditis elegans isolates spanning a range of latitudes, upon warming temperatures and infection by the parasite Leucobacter musarum. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we found that microbiome diversity decreased, and dispersion increased over time, with the former being more prominent in uninfected adults and the latter aggravated by infection. Exposing infected hosts to warming did not have an additive destabilizing effect on their microbiomes. Moreover, warming during pre-adult development alleviated the destabilizing effects of infection on host microbiomes (Li et al., 2024).\n\n\n\nHow does warming impact animal resistance ecology and evolution?\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change is increasing extreme heating events which may potentially exacerbate infectious diseases. Whether hosts can adapt to infection with rising temperatures is important for forecasting species persistence. We tested whether warming—at different host life stages—affects the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans infected by a wild bacterial pathogen. We competed resistant and susceptible genotypes across 10 passages and tracked the spread of resistance in the population. Infection and prolonged warming strongly selected for the resistant genotype. Warming during host development induced plastic defences against infection, reducing the selective pressure for costly genetic-based resistance. Resistance was lost under ambient temperatures and periodic warming. Selection for resistance was likely weakened at ambient temperatures by the dilution effect, whereby the resistant genotype reduced pathogen transmission. Evolutionary dynamics of resistance depend on the balance among pathogen virulence, costs of genetic-based resistance, the dilution effect and plastic defences induced by temperature stress (Li et al., 2025).\n\n\nWhat drives microbiome stability vs. flexibility in wild mammals and how these dynamics feed back onto host fitness?\nWhile experimental systems are valuable for isolating microbial responses to specific perturbances, understanding the fitness consequences of microbiome dynamics in nature requires longitudinal studies at both individual and population levels in wild populations. Most existing work either captures population-level patterns at single timepoint, or relies on laboratory-maintained animals whose microbiomes may not reflect the ecological complexity and variability of natural environments. As a result, we still lack a clear understanding of the drivers of microbiome temporal dynamics, the conditions under which microbiome stability versus flexibility is beneficial, and how these dynamics translate into host fitness outcomes in the wild. Addressing this gap is critical for understanding how microbiome-mediated processes influence animal health and conservation outcomes in a rapidly changing world.\nMy postdoctoral research is currently focusing on addressing this gap by studying microbiome stability and variation in wild mammals, using polar bear as a model system. Polar bears are apex predators and key indicators of Arctic ecosystem health, with populations increasingly threatened by climate change. Polar bears typically experience extreme nutritional stress (prolonged fasting), especially during up to 8-month winter denning period for pregnant females. These conditions provide a natural experiment for identifying microbial taxa that persist under severe perturbation. These persistent microbial taxa may represent functionally or evolutionarily essential components of the host microbiome.\n\n\n\nChurchill region, image from ECCC\n\n\n\n\n\nImage from ECCC\n\n\n\n\n\nImage from ECCC\n\n\nThe Churchill polar bear population in Canada is among the most intensively monitored in the world. Through our collaboration, we have obtained microbiome samples (both rectal and nasal swabs) from over 200 bears across four timepoints over multiple years. Using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, combined with detailed bear metadata, family and geographical information, I will first differentiate host-associated persistent vs. transient microbial taxa, and analyze their evolutionary histories and metabolic functions. We will further investigate how RNA viral infections disrupt microbial stability. Linking viral diversity to microbial restructuring and host body conditions will provide mechanistic insight into microbiome-mediated infection outcomes.\nStay tuned while this project is onging!"
