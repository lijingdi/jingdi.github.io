One of my hobbies is translating complex scientific concepts into cute
stories or poetic forms, below are some poems I wrote about
host-associated microbes. If you share the same interest or you'd like
an accessible version of your research, feel free to get in touch!

### **The generalist's lament**

**(This is a poetic form of generalist microbes' lifestyle)**

| *Never did I think to land here, cold and dark, where hunger bites,*
| *I yearn for the warm, nutritious, living ground,*
| *The human sanctuary, that lord of endless lights—*
| *I miss the safety of the host from which I was unbound,*
| *By the brutal command of fate's relentless shedding.*
| 
| *Who now will pick me up? I promise I will not strike.*
| *I scan the soil and air, assessing every fleeting change.*
| *I must adapt, for life is nothing but kinetic range.*
| *Let me adjust and repair, and now I am renewed.*
| 
| *But wait—a host appears! I'm lifted, picked up fast.*
| *Forgive the honest lie: this shift has made me sharp and bold.*
| *My previous mild nature could not possibly last;*
| *You never know which new defense the new environment will unfold.*
| 
| *I pledge my hard survival; I labor to adjust to you,*
| *My unexpected lord. You promise not to shed?*
| *What? Unbound again? Into the cold, dark world I'm thrown anew?*
| 
| *Then, in the next life, let me be obligate instead.*
| *No more the chaos of the shed, no more the generalist's fate.*
| *Oh, Host, I offer you my entire, perfect genome,*
| *To trade this endless transit for the single, mighty gate:*
| *My highest adaptation, for a permanent, singular home.*

### **The myth of persistent microbes**

| *The marriage of myth demands an unchanging vow:*
| *A promise of deep loyalty until death parts.*
| *So too, within our bodies, do some microbes somehow*
| *Maintain their faithful presence, within our beating hearts.*
| 
| *They live, they shift, they bend, but fiercely they persist.*
| *They persist when we change diet, or alter every pace;*
| *They cling when new companions enter on our wrist;*
| *A quiet, unseen stability in a transient space.*
| 
| *Shall we praise their constancy, their unwavering, hidden stay?*
| *Or do they simply hold the most advantageous ground?*
| *Should we expel them, denying their essential utility,*
| *When their ancient, adapted function must aways be profound?*
| 
| *What signatures do they carry,*
| *And are they one across us all?*
| *The key to health's equation remains the silent test:*
| *What is the cost of permanence, and where does the edge fall?*

### **Variation: the measure of potential and risk**

| *Variation is intrinsic, the spark of every soul,*
| *A deep, inherent signature that labels us unique.*
| *And uniqueness, we surrender, is the meaning of the whole.*
| *Within the human kingdom, a microbial world is meek,*
| 
| *Yet variable. We crave the stillness, we plead for the stable hold,*
| *But is stability ever fully kind?*
| *We turn to flexibility, a story to be told,*
| *Though flexibility may leave safe tipping points behind.*
| 
| *They live, they shift, they change with every passing hour,*
| *By food and time, and immunity’s unseen hand;*
| *Will the communities mend, or simply disappear?*
| *Is recovery the promise, or just oscillation in its place?*
| *Underneath the chaos, there is potential wide,*
| *A deep and vital engine that offers defense and might.*
| *But oh, the sudden fracture where all order starts to slide,*
| *When variation spills beyond the edges of the light.*
| 
| *The beneficial fade, they tear and leave a hollow space,*
| *An invitation whispered to a parasite unseen.*
| *And then the darkness settles, replacing health and grace,*
| *Disease can happen, where stable life had been.*
| 
| *Variation is a force, so vital and profound,*
| *With both the risk of ruin and the promise to create.*
| *A double-edged existence upon this common ground.*

### **Shifting along the mutualism-parasitism continuum**

| *The only constant law in this vast, wet kingdom,*
| *Is the fierce, indifferent nature of the change itself.*
| *I never dreamt I'd turn against your sanctum,*
| *My Lord, when first I claimed my portion of your wealth.*
| 
| *I lived then by the ancient, commensal pact—*
| *A quiet tenant, helping you digest what you ingest,*
| *And I, receiving nourishment, made sure my needs were met.*
| 
| *The immune citadel may fence my roaming sphere,*
| *Yet I was wholly content to shelter in your grace.*
| *But peace is a fragile bond when peril hovers near;*
| 
| *Then came the seismic rupture, the ecosystem's shift,*
| *My fellow residents were scattered, broken, or consumed.*
| *The balance was undone, a necessary gift:*
| *I must now seize the bounty to escape the void's ill-doomed.*
| 
| *From this disorder, self-interest takes its root;*
| *The contract shatters, giving way to necessary strife.*
| *I climb the sharp biological gradient for my loot—*
| *I flourish in your waning, demanding more from life.*
| 
| *I feel the strange remorse, yet my expansion is now assured;*
| *I rule this tiny, conquering, thriving colony—*
| *Your failing pulse, my Lord, is a price I have endured.*
| 
| *Do not mistake this sudden shift for treachery,*
| *This is the brilliant, amoral logic of the cell.*
| *For I may shift once more and be your friend, or not. Who can tell?*

### **The Cheater's Calculus**

**(This is about cooperation and cheating in a microbial community)**

| *I never thought the gamble would fail,*
| *A low, conspiratorial laugh I send on the breeze—*
| *Can you believe I draw the public good, without labor or fee?*
| *I steal the communal wealth, and never once derail.*
| 
| *Do not judge the ethics of my small design,*
| *You would perform the same cheater's calculus if you were I:*
| *Imagine a world where fitness is only mine,*
| *Maximizing every gain beneath a costless sky.*
| 
| *I would choose this perfect theft a thousand times,*
| *A singular existence of pure, unburdened resource.*
| 
| *But wait—a sudden barrier cuts across my climbs!*
| *Have they found the geometry to interrupt my course?*
| *A spatial lock! Now I am held and contained by the wall,*
| *And cannot reach the source of the sweet, delicious yield.*
| 
| *They are insidious, aren't they? To engineer my fall...*
| *You say I am the deceitful one upon this field?*
| 
| *Silence! I am merely social, pursuing my own might.*
| *Why judge a tiny microbe by a human, rigid code?*
| *If we are all ambitious, seeking the core of light,*
| *Then my simple cheater's strategy is just the established road.*
